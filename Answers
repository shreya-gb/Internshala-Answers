Why does Internshala excite you?

Regarding the Internshala Platform, I do have heard many of the golden opportunities being brought to light by the team. So, being with this team and mentors will be an amazing opportunity for me and also for my personal growth. Not just being with them but closely working, Gaining knowledge at the same time, and leading a really really huge and prestigious team to our local institutes will indeed be worth all the time. I have always been dreaming to take up one of such moments as such an opportunity offered by Internshala and would like to take a step and see how one can actually make use of such an opportunity. I really wish to Work closely and dedicate my whole to the Team and Internshala, if given me this Chance. Thank You. Have a good day

How would you create awareness about Internshala in your college?

"Awareness" is not just a small term, but requires a huge amount of Hard and Smartwork to flow hand in hand. If I get a chance, for now as of instance, I will Promote from my nearest Close friends, then my classmates; Gather the like-minded to join me, and spread the word of mouth to classes and so on, and then to Faculty Members, etc. I'll make sure I am equally active on social media as well, for promoting the contents and letting people know about the opportunities offered by "The Team Internshala". For further extensions, I will create groups on "Telegram" and "Whatsapp" for more query related feedbacks. And also, because I am already a part of "The Campus Ambassador Program ", I guess that won't be difficult. But, on a positive note, it'll be interesting to Promote, uplift, and build relationships as a Mediator between the College and "The team Internshala". I hope this would be some of my basic requirements to grow my linkages. If in future there will be an opportunity to enhance my Promotion rates, I am ready to expand the chain. Thank You!
